        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

        <h3>1. Services</h3>
        <p>Patrick Ryan Web Design ("I", "me", "my") provides website design, development, and hosting services for small businesses in Ireland. The specific deliverables, timeline, and pricing will be outlined in the quote provided to you before any work begins.</p>

        <h3>2. Setup Fee and Payment</h3>
        <p>A one-time setup fee is required before work commences on your website. This fee covers the design, development, and initial launch of your website. Payment terms will be specified in your quote.</p>

        <h3>3. Monthly Hosting</h3>
        <p>After your website is launched, a monthly hosting fee applies. This covers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Website hosting and maintenance</li>
            <li>Security updates</li>
            <li>Technical support</li>
            <li>Keeping your website online and accessible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Monthly fees are billed in advance and are due on the same date each month.</p>

        <h3>4. Website Updates and Edits</h3>
        <p>Minor text and image updates are charged at a rate of 20-50 per edit, depending on complexity. Major redesigns or new features will be quoted separately.</p>

        <h3>5. Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your hosting service at any time. However, you must provide at least 4 weeks' written notice before cancellation takes effect. This allows time to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Back up your website files</li>
            <li>Transfer your domain name (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Ensure a smooth transition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon cancellation, your website will be taken offline at the end of the notice period unless alternative arrangements are made.</p>

        <h3>6. Ownership</h3>
        <p>You own your content (text, images, logos) at all times. Your domain name remains your property. Website design files and code remain my intellectual property unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

        <h3>7. Domain Names</h3>
        <p>Domain names may be registered and managed on your behalf. Domains are always registered in the client's name — you own your domain. Domains are billed annually in advance, and you'll receive a renewal invoice each year before your domain expires. If a renewal is not paid by the renewal date, the domain may expire and become unavailable.</p>

        <h3>8. Uptime and Reliability</h3>
        <p>I aim to provide reliable hosting with minimal downtime. However, I cannot guarantee 100% uptime due to factors outside my control (internet outages, server maintenance, etc.). I am not liable for any loss of business or revenue due to website downtime.</p>

        <h3>9. Acceptable Use</h3>
        <p>You agree not to use my services for any illegal, harmful, or offensive purposes. I reserve the right to suspend or terminate services if this policy is violated.</p>

        <h3>10. Liability</h3>
        <p>My liability is limited to the fees paid for services. I am not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of my services.</p>

        <h3>11. Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>I may update these terms from time to time. You will be notified of any significant changes via email.</p>

        <h3>12. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Ireland. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Ireland.</p>

        <h3>13. Contact</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about these terms, please contact:</p>
